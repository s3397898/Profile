<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<hr>


<p>My interest in IT primarily stems from working in the financial services industry, whereby we are constantly having to evolve from an IT perspective in order to not only grow but compete with our peers. Having the ability to utilise IT, allows our offering to be more streamlined and functional for our clients. Although my current level of IT expertise is below average, I am hoping to gain a fundamental background throughout this course. I chose RMIT due to it’s strong reputation and technology focus. During my IT studies, I hope to learn more about cyber security measures. Following this, I hope to adopt what I have learnt and put it into practice in my current role and eventually into a fraud prevention/cyber security aligned role. </p>



<h2>Ideal job</h2>

<p><strong>Experienced Analyst Deloitte</strong></p>



<p>The above role is focused on driving the a more risk focused culture at Deloitte, whilst being at the forefront of the implementation of relevant technological change throughout the organisation. With the ever growing threat of cyber security threats, analysing these threats and solving the associated issues is a crucial part of Deloittes asset and client data protection strategy. This appeals to me as risk is the field of IT that I am most interested in and believe it’s an industry where there is continuously going to demand for a skilled workforce. Although at times it will be a high stress industry, the job satisfaction of delivering a sustainable risk strategy and culture would be an exciting prospect.</p>



<p>As mentioned above a tertiary qualification is required for the role and I’d assume it would be an IT based qualification, Following this, to undertake a position at one of the ‘Big 4” such as Deloitte, considerable experience must be had in a relevant role prior to applying to prove your ability. My current skillset relevant to the role is minimal, with only a basic understanding of IT. However, having worked in a number of industries across the years, transferrable soft skills may become relevant to some aspects of the role. In order to gain the relevant skillset, I first of all will finish my undergraduate studies whilst undertaking bouts of work experience throughout in a risk associated environment in order to ascertain more hands on technical knowledge. I also aim to complete as many online short courses throughout regarding risk minimisation with a few coding courses to further enhance my knowledge. </p>



<h2>Online Tests</h2>

<p>Myer Briggs- ISFP-T</p>

<p>VARK Learning Styles- Your scores were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>	Visual 1</li>

  <li>	Aural 5</li>

  <li>	Read/Write 1</li>

  <li>Kinesthetic 10</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a strong kinesthetic learning preference.</p>

<p>Use the following pages for study strategies that apply to your learning preference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kinesthetic</li>

  <li>Big 5 Personality test-</li>

  <li>Extroversion-63%</li>

  <li>Emotional Stability- 7%</li>

  <li>Agreeableness-14%</li>

  <li>Conscientiousness-62%</li>

  <li>Intellect/Imagination- 28%</li>
</ul>



<p>The results of these tests outline areas of strength and areas of weakness. The VARK learning styles quiz highlighted that I learn best from a more hands on, demonstrative approach, which I agree with. The big 5 personality test indicated that I possess extroversive tendencies which was somewhat suprising to me. I scored low in the emotional stability and agreeableness which is something I will have to be mindful of when working in a team environment. I will look to form a team with members that have complimentary traits to what have been displayed in the big 5 quiz. In the Myer-Briggs test, my result came back as a ISFP-T (adventurer), which was contradictory to the BIG 5 quiz as it indicates introvert tendencies. Along with this, the test concluded that I was stronger in observational qualities which I will look to utilise in a team environment as well as working on my areas of weakness that were identified in judging and assertiveness. When forming a team based on the Myer –Briggs test, as assertiveness was one of my weaknesses I will be looking for team members that possess a more assertive tendencies in order to compliment this. </p>





<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>



<p>The project that I will be undertaking is a cyber security focused game that looks to replicate the security threats that big organisations, particularly financial services firms in relation to data theft. The game that will be utilised in an offtake of capture the flag whereby confidential client data will be the flag and teams must encrypt and build firewalls to protect their data from the threat of opponents whom are trying to obtain the data. Concepts similar to this have been done before however, this is going to have a financial services focus, with specific client data being used.  </p>



<h2>Motivation</h2>
<hr>



<p>This project will be extremely useful for organisations to gain an insight into how vulnerable their confidential data is. According to (Forbes,2018) financial services firms fall victim to cybersecurity attacks 300 times more frequently than businesses in other industries. In order for organisations to understand the seriousness of the ever-growing cyber security threat, they need to first be made aware of how vulnerable their system can be. This project will emulate their current system and allow them to understand, that this is an area where more capital needs to be dispersed for ongoing protection. </p>



<h2>Description</h2>
<hr>



<p>Capture the flag games have been used in the past for training individuals and organisations in the concept of attacking and defensive cyber security strategies. As mentioned above, cyber security and threat minimisation is an area that I believe organisations in the financial services industry often don’t place enough emphasis on. Based on this original concept, this project will build on the structural grounds of capture the flag with a financial services relevant overlay. This means that the ‘flag’ will be vital pieces of client data which could result in litigation for an organisation if it falls into the hands of the wrong people. The main types of information that will be considered as the ‘flag’ will be statements and letters that contain bank account details, identification such as passports and client stockbroking account information.</p>



<p>The structure of the project will be two teams from a financial services organisation.   As we will be allowing for the minimal IT literacy, the aim of the project is for it to be simple enough for everyone to understand whilst providing competitors with knowledge as to how vulnerable their clients’ data is. The competitors will assume two roles throughout both attacking the other sides data and defending their own. Teams will take a forensic approach to the attack of the other teams’ data and will attempt to locate files hidden within files or protected by encryption. The competitors will then have to utilise online tools such as Cryptii to decode the encrypted file. The defending team must ensure that they defend the data. They will need to firstly adopt basic strategies such as strong passwords, 2 factor authentication then onto areas such as firewall development, turning off java script and macros and utilising encryption software to encrypt the files. The defenders will also have to be made aware of phishing attacks and WIFI vulnerabilities. Even if the knowledge of the attackers is minimal, training surrounding phishing attacks is incredibly important in the financial services industry as it is one of the main attacks utilised to steal client data. An example of where this could expose client data for one of the teams is if for instance, one team conducted a phishing attack with an office 365 data box requesting the password from the other team. If the team does not know any better, they may assume it is a legitimate password request, unbeknown to them that they have just passed on their data to other opposing team. Training around 2 factor authentication could provide some form of defence against this.</p>



<p>Upon completion of the project both teams should have a basic understanding of how vulnerable their data can be and some basic measures of which they can put in place in order to protect themselves from such attacks. This will inevitably reduce the risk of a financial services firms data being stolen therefore reducing the likelihood of an expensive litigation claim from a client. </p>







<h2>Tools &amp; Hardware</h2>
<hr>



<p>As this is aimed at finance professionals with limited IT exposure, the aim is to keep the project as simplified as possible. Each team will require a PC which they will use for both attack &amp; defence, with connection to a secure Wi-Fi network. From this, teams will also need to utilise tools such as an encryption decoder such as Cryptii , password generator/ stores for example LastPass, data encryption software, 2 factor authentication, and firewalls anti-virus software.</p>



<p>Along with this, teams will need to be provided with training tools in order to prepare them for using the above software.</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<hr>



<p>The skills that are requires for participants in the game are beyond what the average PC user will generally possess. Therefore, prior to the competition taking place participants must be provided with basic training along with user manuals on how to do certain tasks such as encrypt data, decode the opposing team’s data and basic tasks such as setting up 2 factor authentication.</p>



<p>The aim of this project is not to expose participants to a large scope of technical data, instead provide them with basic knowledge on how to protect their clients’ data.</p>



<h2>Outcome</h2>
<hr>



<p>Upon completion of this project, determination of its success will be evident by the participants being able to put in place protection capabilities in order to protect their clients’ data. This will be displayed by an advancement in their knowledge as to how vulnerable their clients’ data is and the participants ability to put steps in place to protect this.</p>



<p>If this is project is adopted across a wide scale of organisations in the financial services industry, particularly those without their own cyber security teams, we should see an overall decline in the amount of attacks and a reduction in the number of clients’ having their data exploited. This will result in less litigation hence a major cost saving to organisations. </p>
